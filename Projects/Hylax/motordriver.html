<h2>Motor Driver</h2>
    
        Developing new products, the engineers in the company used to create new software from scratch. Even when we reused vendors for parts - we couldn't reuse the controllers code as it was too entangled within the project.
        I proposed a more component-driven approach. To develop a standard interface that we could use between projects. Everytime we would be working on given vendor parts we could add a new library to our collection of drivers.
        It also standardized user control for driver settings and the control of the individual motors.<br/>
        <br/>
        The idea was enthusiastically accepted and we have extended it to standardized controls for Logging. There were plans to add components for Camera and binary/analog IO cards. And finally for a standardized GUI for all applications. Eventually with the new projects we could be working mainly on workflows.<br/>
