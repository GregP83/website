        There was an idea to add the depth control of the laser (industrial lasers donâ€™t shoot in the straight line, they have focus points the same way like when playing with the magnifying glass and the sunbeam). Adjusting depth of laser focus would allow control of the laser operation on 3D objects. That technology was used in mobile phones where the antenna would wrap around the inner sides of the phone enclosure. <br/>

        I was asked to create a prototype based on an open source project written in C. However, my prior experience with WPF taught me that there is a 3D library in WPF word. With that library and one more colleague (he did importing AutoCad files into 3D vectors) we got a prototype working in 4 weeks. Application could import an AutoCad file, present it in 3D, place 2D drawing (modules used from Hypermark) on that 3D model and generate 3D vectors for the laser. Later tests with the actual laser were successful.<br/>

        I was responsible for:
        <ul>
            <li>Application UI</li>
            <li>3D model representation</li>
            <li>Math behind representing 2D vectors on 3D model</li>
        </ul>
