    This project was used for laser marking on the wafer of microchips. It could be a serial number, a text, a QR code or a
    barcode. The software had three views:
    <ul>
      <li>Matrix view: for microchips arrangement on the wafer and order of the marking,</li>
      <li>Chip view: for designing of what will be marked on a single chip,</li>
      <li>Process view: for operation control.</li>
    </ul>
    The driving force of this project was speed, therefore two lasers were executing simultaneously. Software manages both
    lasers and allows the parameters' fine tuning to push the hardware to its limits (balance between markings, readability
    and quality and the performance).<br />

    Here I reused Hypermark DrawPanel and laser control modules.<br />
    I was responsible for whole project<br />
