    While Chromeleon is a capable software platform for analyzing chemical samples in a laboratory setting, there are
    situations where constant monitoring of samples is required, such as for monitoring water quality in a river. To address
    this need, the Chromeleon team developed the Chromeleon Process Analyzer (PA) - a Windows Service that runs in the
    background.
    <br /><br />
    Chromeleon PA connects to the Chromeleon services and continuously generates new experiments from assigned templates,
    monitoring the results and automatically recalibrating the instrument or notifying the user in the case of failed
    results. With multiple potential workflows for handling failed results, the Chromeleon PA is designed to always continue
    operating and monitoring samples.
    <br /><br />
    To interact with the Chromeleon PA, the team developed a desktop application called the Chromeleon PA client. This
    client is used for configuring and interacting with the Process Analyzer service, enabling users to set up experiments,
    monitor results, and receive notifications when necessary.
