UniQC which stands for Universal Quality Check - is a software used for final gate testing of Hearing Instruments.<br />
It collects results of manuals / visual checks by operators and automated tests used by third party measurement
equipment.<br />
<br />
Communication with measurement equipment was executed through port RS232. Test Scripts were stored in a local Database -
which allowed recurrent updates.<br />
Test results are stored in online databases or on the cloud through web services depending on the region.<br />
<br />
I have been involved in every part of this project from design and implementation of UI through workflow to
communication with hardware, databases and web services.<br />
<br />
However my most notable contribution is the proposal of plugin based drivers for Measurement Devices (the same mechanism
as in additional elements in Hypermark: scanning plug-ins folder, opening dll files inside to check if they implement a
given interface and if it is then dynamic instantiation using reflection). It achieved cost reduction when we wanted to
add new hardware support without the burden of a whole new software release.
