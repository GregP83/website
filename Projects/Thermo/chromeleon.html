    Chromeleon is a software platform used for chemical analysis, particularly in the field of chromatography. It enables
    chemists to detect and analyze different components of chemical mixtures. The name Chromeleon is a clever combination of
    chromatography and chameleon, a color-changing animal.
    <br />
    <br />
    The Chromeleon software is capable of controlling instruments, collecting, managing and processing data, and generating
    reports. It is also designed to be compliance-friendly, with features for user management, data versioning, and event
    logging. Additionally, the software can be scaled from a single desktop workstation to an enterprise setup with hundreds
    of instruments and lab computers, and comes with built-in features for instrument servers, data vaults, load balancing,
    and network fault protection.

    <br />But what did I do exactly?
    <ul>
      <li>Implemented features: Intact Protein Deconvolution (IPD) and Non-Targeted Mass Spectra (NTMS) - two different
        algorithms for NTMS were two separate features. Each feature included parameters collection, data processing and
        results presentation in various charts and tables,</li>
      <li>Designed and implemented API & backend for Data Processing Service (windows service for IPD and NTMS above),</li>
      <li>Workflow and API for Application Processing Service - another windows service for very large data sets (processing
        moved from the client to the server and cloud),</li>
      <li>Developed a bridge to the service of another application (BioPharma), allowing our software to use its algorithms
        (C#, SignalR, JSON),</li>
      <li>Performance improvement for searches on the remote machine. Results are propagated and transferred asynchronously
        while search is in progress,</li>
      <li>Performance improvement in New Sequence wizard.</li>
    </ul>
