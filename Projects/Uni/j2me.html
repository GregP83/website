        In the times before the smartphone era, when the phones had physical buttons and small screens. The first applications were written in Java 2 Micro Edition (ME).
        </br></br>
        The topic of my masterâ€™s thesis was Java 2 ME and mobile technologies. </br></br>
        Along with the thesis I wrote a handy application for students of my University. It had:
        <ul>
            <li>Timetable (user could create its own timetable)</li>
            <li>Map of the city with locations and addresses of different buildings,</li>
            <li>Phonebook of the academic staff,</li>
            <li>Academic year schedules,</li>
            <li>Info about the University (like history, faculties, etc.),</li>
            <li>Small ads,</li>
            <li>Quick announcements system,</li>
            <li>Options.</li>
        </ul>
        Small ads and the Quick announcement system utilized a simple system based on the LAMP stack to store and share data.
