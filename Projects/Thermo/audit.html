    Another crucial component of the Ardia platform is the Audit service, which is responsible for logging all user actions, 
    configuration changes, and interactions with data and instruments. This service ensures comprehensive tracking of activities 
    within the system. For example, any updates to user privileges, connections of new client PCs, modifications to instrument 
    configurations, and actions performed on data such as acquisition, modification, or export, are logged and stored in the database. 
    Users can access the log entries and utilize query and filtering capabilities to easily find specific information they are 
    searching for. The Audit service enhances transparency, accountability, and traceability within the Ardia platform, providing 
    valuable insights into user activities and system changes.
