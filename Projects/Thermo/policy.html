    The Ardia cloud platform is a software solution designed for large laboratories. It's primarily cloud-based but can 
    also be installed on powerful PCs stored on premises. It follows a micro-services architecture, providing essential 
    functionalities for data storage, instrument control, data acquisition, processing, and visualization. Additionally, 
    it ensures compliance by offering user management with roles and privileges, as well as audit logs to track user actions 
    for auditing purposes. Ardia serves as a foundational platform, incorporating all the necessary components for various 
    laboratory software products. This allows for easier development of new products in the future, as they can leverage the 
    existing infrastructure and workflows provided by Ardia.

    Policy management is a service within Ardia. My team was tasked with taking over the 
    previous implementation in C#. However, it came with the high complexity and maintenance burden of a large codebase, 
    multiple unused endpoints, and unused tables in the database, among other issues. Since it heavily relies on a library 
    written in GO, the opportunity arose to rewrite the entire service in GO to avoid compatibility issues encountered in C#. 
    <br /><br />
    Initially, my manager was unsure of the idea of rewriting the service in a language we had no experience in. I spent a 
    week (including the weekend) preparing a working prototype and presented an MVP, ultimately getting the green light for 
    the team to pursue that direction. It took us two months to utilize the GIN framework, add Identity validation (via gRPC) 
    to the middle layer, integrate Audit support (via RabbitMQ), and versioned database migrations using GORM extensions. 
    <br /><br />
    The revamped project leveraged the existing database schema, omitting unused tables that were removed, and reimplemented 
    existing endpoints. This approach aimed to minimize disruption to the current installations.
    Service allows CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on 
    policies and enforces (computes if the subject has access or not) the policies stored in the database. 
    The new GO version of the service consumes only 20% of the memory compared to the previous implementation, and it has 
    reduced the latency of large calls for enforcement endpoints by 50%, resulting in a twofold increase in performance.
