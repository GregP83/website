    Connexx is a fitting and hearing aids programming software for Siemens hearing aids. It introduces the world-best BinaxFit and MiconFit fitting
    algorithms to provide the best hearing experience to Siemens customers. Currently Connexx is used by over 400'000 people worldwide (136'000 in the US).

    <br/>I was responsible mainly for a feature called Autofit: it measures the acoustic characteristics of the human ear (actually an audiologist puts 1 inch long pipe into your ear! - and as we cooperated closely with the audiologist team we were often used as test subjects :) and based on individual characteristics it calculates how a hearing instrument needs to be programmed to produce sound as close to natural as possible.
    <br/>
    <br/>With the team we designed the user interface and workflow from scratch. Feature requires cooperation with measuring hardware (produced by Siemens or third party companies) and programmer of the hearing instrument. Furthermore extended range of potential customers by adding 3 measurement devices (2 in C#, 1 in C++).

    <br/>My other contribution:
    <ul>
      <li>
        rendered technical support for risk analysis: prepared design documentation and implemented 2 high-risk features <br/>  (infant warning and output to patient's ear)
      </li>
      <li>
        proposed vent size calculations for all supported fitting algorithms
      </li>
      <li>
        removed lots of bugs and added tons of new unit tests to guard code quality. 
      </li>
    </ul>
