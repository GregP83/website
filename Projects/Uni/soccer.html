        Example of an expert system (AI) used in a logical game. This game was prepared as a WXClips extension to NASA's CLIPS (expert system shell).
        <br/>
        <br/>Rules of the game: 
        <br/>Player has to put the ball to the opponent's goal. The ball leaves the line after each move. Normally the player can move only once, but if the destination node is not clean (has some lines passing by) he can make another move. The round is over when the ball is on the empty node or in the goal. 
        <br/>
        <br/>This AI level could cause some problems for the average player (it almost beat my professor - luckily for me the professor won, but it was a close one)<br/>
